#About
I am a web developer who has learned HTML, CSS, and JS in college and React and APIs from various online platforms.
I have found a website called Frontend Mentor that provides real-world coding challenges for web developers.
I am using this repository to post the projects that I complete from Frontend Mentor.
The projects start from basic level so I revise my core concepts and gradually increase in difficulty and complexity as I get more practice and improve my skills.
